Webhooks: `createWebhooks()` (core) and the `webhooks` option of `createOpenBookingApp` send signed `booking.held`, `.confirmed`, `.updated` and `.cancelled` events with retries; `verifyWebhook()` checks them on the receiving side. Replays and no-op cancels don't send events (`BookingEvent.unchanged` marks the latter).
