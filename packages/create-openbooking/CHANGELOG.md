# create-openbooking

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 98658a9: New projects depend on each package's own version. 0.2.0 asked for `@openbooking-sh/postgres@^0.2.0`, which doesn't exist (postgres went from 0.1.1 to 0.3.0), so `npm install` failed.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4d9f0fc: Better for agents and safer in public, from a fresh-eyes test of the SDK:

  - New MCP tool `get_business_info`: services, staff, opening hours and booking window.
  - Search: ask for a staff member by name with `staff` (any capitalisation, also in `preferences`/`tags`). Unknown names fail with the valid choices instead of returning nothing. Slots list `also_available` staff, and holds and bookings say who is booked. Searching a closed day says so.
  - `party_size` defaults to 1, search returns 20 slots by default, and tool descriptions fit appointments as well as tables.
  - New holds are limited per caller IP (default 20 per 10 minutes; `holdLimit` to tune). Core exports `RateLimiter`, `MemoryRateLimiter` and `clientIpFromHeaders`; actors carry `ip`.
  - Providers can expose opening hours with `getVenueInfo`.
