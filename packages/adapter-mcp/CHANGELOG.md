# @openbooking-sh/adapter-mcp

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 7c9ad2d: Rescheduling. `service.reschedule()` and the `reschedule_booking` MCP tool move a confirmed booking to another time for the same service and party size, keeping its id and confirmation code. Allowed while cancellation is still free (`reschedule_not_allowed` after that), with explicit consent. Providers implement the optional `rescheduleBooking`; `BookingRecordStore.move` does it atomically in the memory and Postgres stores (both resources locked in a fixed order).
- e4b56d6: Staff working hours and time off. `VenueConfig.schedules` gives any resource weekly hours (within opening hours) and time off (whole days or exact times, venue-local, DST-safe); availability and holds respect both. `VenueInfo.staff_hours` and the MCP `get_business_info` tool tell agents who works when; time off stays private.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4d9f0fc: Better for agents and safer in public, from a fresh-eyes test of the SDK:

  - New MCP tool `get_business_info`: services, staff, opening hours and booking window.
  - Search: ask for a staff member by name with `staff` (any capitalisation, also in `preferences`/`tags`). Unknown names fail with the valid choices instead of returning nothing. Slots list `also_available` staff, and holds and bookings say who is booked. Searching a closed day says so.
  - `party_size` defaults to 1, search returns 20 slots by default, and tool descriptions fit appointments as well as tables.
  - New holds are limited per caller IP (default 20 per 10 minutes; `holdLimit` to tune). Core exports `RateLimiter`, `MemoryRateLimiter` and `clientIpFromHeaders`; actors carry `ip`.
  - Providers can expose opening hours with `getVenueInfo`.
